# ⚠️ FRESH START - READ THIS FIRST

**Date:** 2026-02-09  
**Status:** ALL TASKS RESET TO NOT DONE  
**Reason:** warcraftcn-ui integration as UI foundation

---

## What Happened?

We are starting **COMPLETELY FRESH**. All previous work has been:
- Archived to `memory.md` under "Previous Attempt (2026-02-03 to 2026-02-07)"
- Marked as reference only - DO NOT USE directly
- All tasks reset to **NOT DONE**

---

## Why?

**warcraftcn-ui** (https://github.com/TheOrcDev/warcraftcn-ui) provides:
- Superior retro UI components with RTS aesthetics
- Light pillar effects perfect for unlock animations
- Accessibility out of the box
- Modern Next.js/React/TypeScript stack

We want to build on this solid foundation rather than reinventing UI components.

---

## What's New?

### Phase 0: warcraftcn-ui Integration (NEW)
**Before building any app features, we must:**
1. Extract warcraftcn-ui components
2. Adapt to power-number color palette
3. Integrate light pillar effects
4. Customize for wellness theme

**Timeline:** 1 week (Sprints 0.1 and 0.2)

### Updated Documents
- `todo.md` - All tasks reset, Phase 0 added
- `implementation-plan.md` - 201 tasks (was 187)
- `memory.md` - Previous work archived
- `tasks.json` - All statuses reset to "TODO"
- `.context/ui/warcraftcn-ui-integration.md` - New integration guide
- `.context/ui/overview.md` - Updated with warcraftcn-ui

---

## What Do I Need To Know?

### 1. NOTHING IS DONE
- Previous work is archived, not usable
- Start from scratch with warcraftcn-ui

### 2. PHASE 0 COMES FIRST
- Complete warcraftcn-ui integration BEFORE Phase 1
- UI foundation must be solid before building features

### 3. USE WARCRAFTCN-UI COMPONENTS
- Extract components to `src/components/ui/`
- Adapt colors to power-number palette
- Use light pillars for unlock animations

### 4. ADAPT AESTHETIC
- From: War/RTS theme
- To: Wonder/Consciousness theme
- Keep: Light pillars, atmospheric effects, animations
- Soften: Aggressive edges, combat imagery
