# 02 - Somanaut Team Roster

*This document provides the core profiles for the Somanaut team of the `Anamnesis Engine` expedition. It details their roles, psychological drivers, and biological signatures within the `Somatic Canticles` universe.*

## 1. Dr. Jian Li - The Neuro-Cartographer

- **Role:** Neuro-Cartographer
- **Specialty:** Somatic Datascape Mapping & Predictive Algorithmic Modeling.
- **Dominant Neuro-Endocrine Axis (Enneagram):** **Pituitary-Thalamic Axis (Type 5 - The Investigator).** His system prioritizes higher-order cognitive processing, pattern recognition, and data synthesis. He perceives the universe as information requiring structure.
- **Function on Team:** Jian is the map-maker. He renders the chaotic, non-linear biological environment into traversable, three-dimensional maps. His mind is the high-command for the expedition, providing the team with their sense of location, direction, and structural understanding.
- **Psychological Profile:** A brilliant and incisive intellectual who finds immense security in knowledge and competence. He can be emotionally detached, viewing feelings as corrupted or unreliable data. He is not arrogant, but can be dismissive of anything that cannot be quantified. The chaos of a raw, unprocessed biological system is a deep personal offense to him.
- **Narrative Arc:** Jian's journey is about discovering the limits of logic. He must learn that the map is not the territory and that some truths can only be understood through direct, embodied experience. He will have to learn to trust the "unreliable data" of Sona's intuition and Gideon's gut feelings to solve problems his intellect cannot. His arc is about integrating his powerful mind with the wisdom of the body.

## 2. Gideon Vance - The Systems Immunologist

- **Role:** Systems Immunologist
- **Specialty:** Bio-Threat Assessment & Inflammatory Cascade Mitigation.
- **Dominant Neuro-Endocrine Axis (Enneagram):** **Adrenal Axis (Type 8 - The Challenger).** His physiology is primed for threat response. His baseline production of cortisol and adrenaline is higher than average, making him hyper-aware of danger but also giving him immense resilience and a powerful presence in the somatic field.
- **Function on Team:** Gideon is the shield. He is the team's anchor to the primal, reptilian reality of the body. He identifies and neutralizes biological threats—cytokine storms, rogue microglia, autoimmune responses. In the datascapes, his Khalorēē Field Architecture is a gravitational force that can stabilize the team during moments of high stress.
- **Psychological Profile:** Decisive, grounded, and fiercely protective of his team, who he considers his sole responsibility. His worldview is often binary: threat/non-threat, safe/unsafe. He trusts his gut implicitly. While he respects the doctors, he views their intellectualism as a vulnerability in a crisis. He fears being controlled or overwhelmed above all else.
- **Narrative Arc:** Gideon's journey is about redefining strength. He must learn that not every threat can be met with force and that some barriers must be dissolved with vulnerability rather than shattered with will. His arc will force him to confront situations where his protective instincts are the very thing causing harm, pushing him to find a new kind of power in yielding and trust.

## 3. Dr. Sona Rey - The Bio-Acoustic Engineer

- **Role:** Bio-Acoustic Engineer
- **Specialty:** Cellular Resonance & Emotional Frequency Analysis.
- **Dominant Neuro-Endocrine Axis (Enneagram):** **Cardiac-Thymic Axis (Type 4 - The Individualist).** Her system is uniquely attuned to the subtle, resonant frequencies of the body. She experiences the bio-field not as data, but as a symphony of emotion, identity, and memory.
- **Function on Team:** Sona is the sensor. She is the team's emotional and intuitive compass. She can distinguish the "frequency of fear" from the "frequency of joy" in the vibrations of a cell membrane. She hears the "music" beneath the biological noise, providing the crucial context and meaning that Jian's maps lack.
- **Psychological Profile:** Deeply empathetic, intuitive, and creative. She feels everything, which is both her greatest gift and her greatest burden. Prone to periods of melancholy as she absorbs the residual pain of the systems she navigates. She fears being insignificant or without a unique identity, driving her to find the hidden, beautiful truth in even the most damaged systems.
- **Narrative Arc:** Sona's journey is about learning to be a channel, not just a container. She must find the line between feeling a system's pain and being consumed by it. Her challenge is to develop the emotional objectivity required to translate the "Myocardial Chorus" without letting its sorrow drown her, finding her unique strength not in feeling alone, but in profound, stable connection.

## 4. Dr. Corvan "Corv" Singh - The Psycho-Pathologist & Team Lead

- **Role:** Psycho-Pathologist & Somanaut Team Lead
- **Specialty:** Narrative Diagnostics & Systems Integration.
- **Dominant Neuro-Endocrine Axis (Enneagram):** **Integrated Tri-Axial Candidate (Type 9 - The Peacemaker).** His ultimate potential is to achieve a harmonious balance between the Pituitary, Adrenal, and Cardiac axes, making him the stable center point. He is the living embodiment of the Tryambakam Protocol in training.
- **Function on Team:** Corv is the storyteller. He is the central processor who synthesizes the logical maps from Jian, the threat assessments from Gideon, and the emotional resonance from Sona into a single, coherent diagnosis. He reads the *story* of the disease, the *narrative* of the trauma. As team lead, he makes the final strategic decisions.
- **Psychological Profile:** A calm, patient, and holistic thinker who can see all sides of a problem. His deepest drive is to restore harmony and wholeness, which can sometimes lead him to avoid necessary conflict. He carries the immense weight of the team's psychological health on his shoulders. He is the quiet center of the storm.
- **Narrative Arc:** Corv's journey is about moving from a passive Witness to an active Alchemist. He must learn that true harmony sometimes requires him to instigate a crisis (like booting the Anamnesis Engine) rather than smoothing things over. His arc is about integrating his own internal conflicts and embracing his authority, becoming the decisive, stable, and fully integrated leader the team needs to complete the ultimate goal: The Ripening.
