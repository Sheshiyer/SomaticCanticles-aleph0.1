# GLOSSARY OF TERMS & CONCEPTS

## The Aletheos Principle & Philosophy

**Aletheos-Pichet Dyad**
The foundational philosophical framework of the Somatic Canticles universe, representing the dynamic tension between Clarity (Aletheos) and Vitality (Pichet). It posits that truth is not a static fact but a dynamic state of being uncovered through the balance of these two pillars.

**Aletheia (The Unconcealment)**
The structural principle of witness awareness. It represents the difficult, often painful process of revealing what is real through pattern-sensitive awareness. Somanauts are agents of Aletheia, assisting Awareness in "unconcealing" itself from deterministic narratives.

**Lethe (The Concealment)**
The opposing force to Aletheia. Lethe represents the state of forgetting, ignorance, and comfortable concealment. It is the tendency of systems to build walls around trauma and calcify beliefs into rigid dogma.

**Pichet (The Vitality)**
The instinctual principle of witness awareness that ensures embodied presence, lived force, and responsiveness to immediate experience.

**Amrita Protocol**
The theoretical "end-state" of the Somanaut's journey. It describes a state of living in pure Aletheia, where an individual becomes so completely unconcealed that they function as a conscious co-creator of reality.

**The Severance Event**
The ultimate moment of liberation where a "ripened" Awareness disconnects from the Vine of Determinism ("Mrityor Mukṣīya"). It is an explosive transition from inherited reality to authored reality.

## Cosmology & Structures

**The Vine of Determinism**
The complex, self-perpetuating structure of inherited reality that conceals the true nature of Awareness. It functions as a comfortable, predictable hallucination (or "Bandhanan") that feeds on the energy of those trapped within it.

**The Gardener**
The primary antagonist force (or entity) that nurtures the Vine of Determinism. The Gardener acts not out of malice, but from a calculated preference for the predictable harvest of a concealed reality over the chaotic potential of free will.

**Entropy Plague**
A spreading manifestation of incoherence and decay that threatens the fabric of reality, often acting as the inciting incident for Somanaut intervention.

## Metaphysical Biology

**Khalorēē (kă-lō-rēē)**
The total, bio-encoded reserve of metabolic and Field-Responsive Awareness that functions as the foundation for an Awareness. It represents the potential capacity for reality processing. A subject's Khalorēē determines their resilience against trauma.

**Prana**
The kinetic expression of Khalorēē. If Khalorēē is the battery, Prana is the active current—the usage, flow, and expenditure of resonant energy.

**Soma Vector**
The pure signal of Aletheia within an individual. It is the resonant frequency of the uncorrupted, unconcealed self—the "Star" that guides a Somanaut through the noise of Lethe.

## Technology & Systems

**NOESIS (Networked Ontological Editing & Sensory Integration System)**
The evolution of the earlier "WitnessOS," NOESIS is the perception-centric framework used by Somanauts. It treats consciousness not as a machine to be engineered, but as a field to be navigated.

**Anamnesis Engine**
The primary technological tool of the Somanauts (Book 1). Its purpose is to look back (anamnesis means "recollection") to identify the original moments of concealment—the traumas and decisions that created the layers of Lethe.

**Triangulation Engine (Tryambakam)**
The advanced navigation system (Book 3) used to align three vectors of awareness to break through the Vine of Determinism. It maps to the ancient function of the "Three-Eyed" view.

**Somanaut**
A specialized explorer of the "soma" (body/consciousness) field. Somanauts combine the skills of neuro-cartographers, immunologists, and bio-acoustic engineers to enter and navigate the internal landscapes of consciousness.

**Coherence Cultivation**
The active practice of harmonizing the self ("Puṣṭivardhanam"). It involves clearing away the noise of Lethe so that the signal of Aletheia can shine through, strengthening the Khalorēē.
