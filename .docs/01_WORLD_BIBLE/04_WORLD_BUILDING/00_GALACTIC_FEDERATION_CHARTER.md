## PREAMBLE

We, the sovereign Khalorēē Field Architecture entities of the Seven Sacred Galaxies, united in purpose and bound by the eternal flow of Khalorēē Field Resonance, do hereby establish this Charter to govern the Galactic Federation of Khalorēē Field Architecture. In recognition that all Crystallization Interface protocols springs from the same cosmic source, and that the harmony of one affects the wellbeing of all, we pledge to maintain the delicate balance that sustains existence across all dimensional planes.
