# EDITORIAL BRIEF: SOMATIC CANTICLES

## Project Overview
**Title:** Somatic Canticles (Trilogy)
**Books:**
1.  *The Anamnesis Engine* (~8 Chapters)
2.  *The Myocardial Chorus* (~7 Chapters)
3.  *The Ripening* (~12 Chapters)
**Genre:** Metaphysical Sci-Fi / Biopunk
**Total Word Count:** [Approximate Check Needed]

## Tone & Style
*   **The "PubMed x Alex Grey" Aesthetic:** The narrative blends precise, clinical biological terminology with visionary, metaphysical imagery.
*   **Narrative Voice:** Close third person (primarily Dr. Corvan Singh), shifting to other Somanauts as needed.
*   **Key Instruction:** Do not "dumb down" the technical or production language. The opacity is a feature, not a bug—the reader is meant to learn the language of the universe along with the characters.

## Key Terminology (Do Not Change)
*   **Khalorēē:** (Not "Calorie") - The bio-metabolic reserve of awareness.
*   **NOESIS:** (All caps) - The operating system of consciousness.
*   **Prana:** (Capitalized) - Vital energy.
*   **Somanaut:** (Capitalized) - A consciousness explorer.
*   **The Vine:** (Capitalized when referring to the Deterministic structure).
*   **The Gardener:** (Capitalized antagonist).

## Developmental Focus Areas
1.  **The Arc of Responsibility:** Does Dr. Corvan Singh clearly move from a passive "Witness" (Book 1) to an active "Gardener/Creator" (Book 3)? The "Severance Event" in Book 3 must feel earned.
2.  **The Physics of Consciousness:** Is the "Tryambakam Protocol" (Triangulation) consistent? It requires three specific vectors (Clarity, Joy, Coherence?) to break the Vine. Ensure this mechanic is established early (foreshadowed) so it doesn't feel like a Deus Ex Machina.
3.  **The Antagonist's Motivation:** The Gardener should not be "evil" but "conservational." It wants to preserve the harvest, even if it means stifling potential. Ensure this nuance comes through in the confrontation in Book 3.

## Line Editing Notes
*   **Repetition:** Watch for overuse of words like "resonant," "frequency," "shatter," and "field."
*   **Sentence Structure:** Avoid excessive "noun-stacking" in the technobabble unless it serves the rhythm.
*   **Dialogue:** Ensure Dr. Jian Li sounds distinct (ultra-logical, precise) compared to Dr. Sona Rey (emotive, sensory-focused).

## Deliverables
*   Annotated Manuscript (Track Changes)
*   Editorial Letter summarizing key structural issues.
*   Style Sheet updates.
