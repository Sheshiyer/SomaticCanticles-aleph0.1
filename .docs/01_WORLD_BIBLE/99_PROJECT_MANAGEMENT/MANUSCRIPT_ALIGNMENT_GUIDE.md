# MANUSCRIPT ALIGNMENT GUIDE

## **Overview**
This document provides specific guidance for aligning the Somatic Canticles manuscript with the updated World Bible constants. It identifies inconsistencies and provides solutions for maintaining narrative coherence while ensuring technical accuracy.

## **CRITICAL ALIGNMENT ISSUES**

### **1. Character Name Consistency**
**Issue:** Manuscript uses different character names than CONSTANTS.md
**Solution:** Update CONSTANTS.md to match manuscript names (COMPLETED)

### **2. Missing Cultural Context**
**Issue:** Manuscript references rich galactic cultures not documented in World Bible
**Solution:** Created SEVEN_GALACTIC_CULTURES.md (COMPLETED)

### **3. Technology System Gaps**
**Issue:** Manuscript uses advanced systems not documented in World Bible
**Solution:** Created TRIANGULATION_ENGINE_SPECS.md (COMPLETED)
