# Core Concept Definitions

## **Khalorēē** (kă-lō-rēē) *n.*

1.  **[Metaphysical Biology]** The total, bio-encoded reserve of metabolic and Quantum Systems Field Resonance that functions as the operating system for a Khalorēē Field Architecture. It represents the foundational store of potential reality-processing capacity.
2.  **[Somanautics]** The deep, structural framework of belief—the "Vine of Determinism"—that dictates the *efficiency* of reality metabolism. A subject's Khalorēē determines the ultimate resilience of their system against trauma and incoherence.
3.  **[Usage Note]** Khalorēē is the stored potential, the deep reserve of Khalorēē Field Architecture Field Resonance. **Prana** is its kinetic expression—the active usage, flow, and expenditure of that Field Resonance. One's Prana is drawn from their Khalorēē.
4.  **[Colloquial]** An individual's Bio-Acoustic constitution or life-force battery. Ex: "It wasn't his body that gave out; the shock shattered his Khalorēē."
