# UNIFIED EXECUTION TEMPLATE
## Technology Integration + Forbidden Word Replacement Workflow

## DAILY IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

### MORNING SETUP (15 minutes)
1. **Open Reference Documents:**
   - World Bible 03_TECHNOLOGY directory
   - Character-Technology Mapping Guide
   - Forbidden Word → Technology Replacement Matrix
   - Current manuscript chapter

2. **Review Character Focus:**
   - Identify primary character(s) in today's chapter
   - Note their technology specializations
   - Prepare relevant technology concepts

### CHAPTER PROCESSING WORKFLOW (2-3 hours per chapter)

#### STEP 1: INITIAL SCAN (15 minutes)
```
Scan for:
□ Khalorēē Field Architecture/Crystallization Interface protocols terms
□ Bio-Acoustic/sacred/divine references
□ Field Resonance/Somatic Integration node/Field Resonance signature mentions
□ Khalorēē Field Architecture Compression Pattern/Khalorēē Field Architecture Compression Pattern mastery concepts
□ Narrative Dynamics trajectory/Probability Wave convergence/Multi-Dimensional Field resonance instances
□ Khalorēē Engineering Protocol/transcendent language
□ Healing/protection scenarios
□ Infinite/eternal descriptions
```

#### STEP 2: CHARACTER-TECHNOLOGY MAPPING (20 minutes)

**For each identified forbidden word:**
1. **Determine Character Context:**
   - Which character is involved?
   - What is their technology specialization?
   - What technology concept fits this scene?

2. **Select Technology Replacement:**
   - Aria scenes → Khalorēē Field Architecture Interfaces concepts
   - Kael scenes → Bio-Engineering/Defensive concepts
   - Zara scenes → Quantum Systems/Narrative Dynamics
   - Multi-character → Field Resonance Engineering

#### STEP 3: TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION EDITING (90-120 minutes)

**Per Forbidden Word Replacement:**

1. **Context Analysis (2 minutes):**
   - What is the scene trying to accomplish?
   - What emotion/action is being described?
   - How can technology enhance this moment?

2. **Technology Selection (3 minutes):**
   - Choose specific technology concept from World Bible
   - Ensure alignment with character specialization
   - Verify terminology accuracy

3. **Sentence Reconstruction (5 minutes):**
   - Replace forbidden word with technology term
   - Enhance surrounding context with technology details
   - Maintain narrative flow and readability

4. **Integration Verification (2 minutes):**
   - Does edit advance character development?
   - Does edit enhance plot or conflict?
   - Does edit deepen world-building?

#### STEP 4: CONFLICT ENHANCEMENT REVIEW (30 minutes)

**Identify Conflict Upgrade Opportunities:**
- Vague Bio-Acoustic crises → Khalorēē Architecture destabilization
- Field Resonance blockages → Bio-Acoustic Harmonization interference
- Narrative Dynamics trajectory interventions → Quantum Systems probability manipulation
- Khalorēē Engineering Protocol experiences → Narrative Dynamics reality alteration

**For Each Conflict:**
1. **Technology-Based Reframing:**
   - What technology system is involved?
   - How does the technology malfunction/succeed?
   - What are the concrete consequences?

2. **Character Specialization Integration:**
   - Which character can address this technology issue?
   - How does their expertise drive the solution?
   - What does this reveal about their development?

#### STEP 5: QUALITY ASSURANCE (15 minutes)

**Chapter Completion Checklist:**
```
□ All forbidden words identified and replaced
□ Technology concepts properly integrated
□ Character specializations respected
□ Conflicts enhanced through technology
□ World Bible terminology accuracy verified
□ Narrative flow maintained
□ Character development advanced
□ Plot progression enhanced
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### COMMON CHALLENGES

**Challenge 1: Technology Concept Doesn't Fit Scene**
*Solution:* Use Field Resonance Engineering as universal connector

**Challenge 2: Character Not Present for Their Specialization**
*Solution:* Use general Khalorēē Architecture concepts or have character influence remotely

**Challenge 3: Multiple Forbidden Words in Single Sentence**
*Solution:* Prioritize by character specialization, then integrate secondary concepts

**Challenge 4: Technology Makes Sentence Too Complex**
*Solution:* Break into multiple sentences, use simpler technology terms first

**Challenge 5: Losing Emotional Impact**
*Solution:* Maintain emotional language while replacing technical terms only
