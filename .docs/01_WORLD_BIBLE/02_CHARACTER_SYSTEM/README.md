### Cultural Enhancement
- **Musical System**: Programmatic music generation for cultural depth
- **Cultural Database**: Musical taxonomy for houses, territories, characters
- **Implementation**: Technical roadmap for music integration

## Usage Guidelines
- **For Book Generation**: Load family/political context first, then individual characters
- **For Character Development**: Reference Khalorēē systems and Khalorēē Field Architecture territories
- **For Cultural Authenticity**: Use musical database for emotional resonance
- **For Plot Integration**: Characters' political affiliations drive conflicts

## Cross-References
