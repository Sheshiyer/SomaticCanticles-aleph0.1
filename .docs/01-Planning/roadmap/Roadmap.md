**Goal**: Beta testing and public release

### Week 7: Refinement
- [ ] Mobile responsive optimization
- [ ] Audio player enhancements
- [ ] Animation polish
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility audit

### Week 8: Launch
- [ ] Beta testing (13 users)
- [ ] Feedback integration
- [ ] Marketing materials
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Public launch (44-day cycle begins)

**Deliverable**: Public webapp + 13 beta testers

---

## Post-Launch (Month 3+)

### Expansion Content
- [ ] Record remaining 6 canticles
- [ ] Add advanced chapters
- [ ] Create community features
- [ ] Build teacher/training module

### Analytics & Iteration

## Resource Allocation

### Time Budget (8 weeks = 44 days)
- Development: 50% (22 days)
- Content Creation: 30% (13 days)
- Design/UX: 15% (7 days)
- Testing/Polish: 5% (2 days)

### Tools & Budget
- Hosting: Vercel (free tier)
- Database: Supabase (free tier)
- Audio: Logic Pro (existing)
- Design: Figma (free tier)
- Storage: Cloudflare R2 (existing)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Biorhythm API accuracy | High | Test against known calculators |
| Audio recording delays | Medium | Batch record, use placeholder audio |
| Unlock logic complexity | Medium | Start simple, iterate |
| User engagement | High | Beta test early, gather feedback |
