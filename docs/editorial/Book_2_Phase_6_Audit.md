# Book 2 Phase 6 Audit Log: Final Quality Gates

## B2-P6-001: Aletheos Ch 4-7 Balance
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Criteria:** Balance between Structural Clarity (Technical/Systemic) and Embodied Vitality (Visceral/Sensory).
**Analysis:**
- **Structural Clarity:** Strong. Concepts like "Anamnesis Engine," "Khalorēē protocols," and "Resonant Self-Consciousness" are clearly defined and consistently used.
- **Embodied Vitality:** Present but stylized. Descriptions use biological metaphors ("endoplasmic reticulum," "osmotic stress") to ground the metaphysical.
- **Balance:** The text leans towards the Systemic/Abstract, which fits the "Anamnesis Engine" (Reboot) and "Myocardial Chorus" (Integration) themes.
- **Stylistic Note:** The use of "unison dialogue" ("They said in unison...") in Chapters 4 and 5 reinforces the "Chorus" theme but risks feeling mechanical. This is accepted as a deliberate stylistic choice for the "Unified Field" state.
- **Verdict:** The balance supports the narrative goal of "Systematized Compassion."

## B2-P6-002: PubMed Accuracy Check
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Analysis of Biological Metaphors (Ch 4-7):**
- **Ch 4 (Anamnesis/Reboot):**
  - "Stressed endoplasmic reticulum... singing the song of cellular distress" -> Accurate reference to the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR).
  - "Cellular mitosis... membrane potentials and ion cascades" -> Accurate physiological mechanisms.
  - "Controlled apoptosis that enables tissue renewal" -> Accurate description of programmed cell death in development.
- **Ch 5 (Myocardial/Heart):**
  - "Heart field" -> Accurate developmental biology term.
  - "Organizing centers in morphogenesis" -> Accurate reference to Spemann organizer concept.
- **Ch 6 (Three-Body/Brain):**
  - "Synaptic weights," "Neurotransmitter systems," "Homeostatic regulation" -> Accurate neuroscience/physiology terms.
  - "Reptilian/Limbic/Neocortex" -> Uses MacLean's Triune Brain model. While modern neuroscience is more nuanced, this is a valid somatic/psychological framework for the narrative.
- **Verdict:** Biological metaphors are scientifically grounded and effectively used to anchor metaphysical concepts.

## B2-P6-003: Multi-Sensory Validation
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Sensory Audit (Ch 4-7):**
- **Visual:** "Living luminescent lattice," "Ruby light," "Synaptic cathedral," "Fractal sanctuary," "Crystalline forms."
- **Auditory:** "Bio-acoustic sensors," "Harmonic dissonance," "Living orchestra," "Chorus," "Symphony."
- **Tactile/Somatic:** "Warmth," "Heat of transformation," "Solid as bedrock," "Mist," "Physical weight."
- **Proprioceptive/Kinesthetic:** "Sank deeper," "Expansion," "Shift from defense to support," "Flowing stream."
- **Verdict:** Strong multi-sensory engagement across all chapters.

## B2-P6-004: Opacity Audit
**Status:** PASSED
**Analysis:**
- Search for "seemingly," "perhaps," "somehow," "maybe," "sort of" yielded 0 matches in the active manuscript.
- **Verdict:** Text is assertive and clear.

## B2-P6-005: Repetitive Phrasing Audit
**Status:** PASSED
**Findings:**
- "Revelation that felt like a key turning in a lock" -> Preserved in Ch 1. Replaced in Ch 2 ("sudden alignment"), Ch 4 ("pulse of recognition").
- "Revelation that felt like a geometric proof clicking into place" -> Replaced in Ch 3 ("archetype finding its true form"), Ch 5 ("chord resolving to the tonic"), Ch 6 ("complex equation solving itself"), Ch 7 ("fractal pattern finding its origin").
**Verdict:** Repetition resolved. Each variation reinforces the chapter's thematic focus.
