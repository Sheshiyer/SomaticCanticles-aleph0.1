# Book 3 Editorial Pass: The Ripening

## Objective
Execute a deep editorial polish on *Book 3: The Ripening*. Focus on enhancing somatic directness, ensuring voice consistency (Nine Muses: Polyhymnia/Urania), and sharpening the "Evolution vs. Entropy" thematic spine.

## Key Themes
- **The Ripening**: The transition from healing to transcendence.
- **The Gardener**: The antagonist force (Entropy/Determinism).
- **The Three Vectors**: Joy, Catalyst, Coherence.

## Phase 1: Global Polish
- [ ] **B3-ED-001: Filter Word Elimination**
  - Remove: *felt, saw, heard, knew, realized, wondered, thought*.
  - Convert to active somatic experience (e.g., "He felt fear" -> "Fear constricted his chest").
- [ ] **B3-ED-002: Somatic Vocabulary Enhancement**
  - Replace generic terms with specific anatomical/energetic descriptors.
  - *mind* -> *neocortical lattice*, *Manas Interface*.
  - *heart* -> *myocardium*, *rhythmic center*.
  - *body* -> *somatic field*, *fascia*.
- [ ] **B3-ED-003: Terminology Capitalization Audit**
  - Verify: *The Ripening, The Gardener, Entropy Plague, Triangulation Engine, Three-Point Problem, Void of Pure Potential*.
- [ ] **B3-ED-004: Dialogue Tag Pruning**
