# WORLD BUILDING

## Purpose
This directory contains the political, social, and cosmic context that shapes the Somatic Canticles universe. These files establish the larger world beyond individual characters and technical systems.

## Processing Order for LLMs
1. **00_GALACTIC_FEDERATION_CHARTER.md** - Governing structure of the universe
2. **01_GALACTIC_FEDERATION_TRANSFORMATION_PLAN.md** - How the universe is evolving
3. **02_QUANTUM_AWARENESS_INTEGRATION.md** - Khalorēē Field Architecture-quantum mechanics integration
4. **03_QUANTUM_SIGIL_INTEGRATION.md** - Symbolic-quantum Khalorēē Field Architecture systems
5. **04_TAROT_BIOLOGICAL_EVENT_MAP.md** - Archetypal-biological event correlations

## Dependencies
- **00_CORE_FOUNDATION**: Must understand Khalorēē Field Architecture engineering principles
- **01_PROTOCOLS_AND_SYSTEMS**: Must understand how systems work
- **02_CHARACTER_SYSTEM**: Characters exist within this world context

## Key Concepts for LLM Context
- **Galactic Federation**: The political structure governing Khalorēē Field Architecture evolution
- **Transformation Plan**: How the universe is systematically evolving Khalorēē Field Architecture
- **Quantum Integration**: How Khalorēē Field Architecture and quantum mechanics merge
- **Sigil Systems**: Symbolic Khalorēē Field Architecture programming
- **Archetypal Biology**: How universal patterns manifest in biological systems

## World Context Layers

### Political Structure
- **Galactic Federation**: Overarching governance
- **House Politics**: Regional Khalorēē Field Architecture governance (see Character System)
- **Local Systems**: Individual planet/station governance

### Khalorēē Field Architecture Evolution
- **Universal Plan**: Systematic Khalorēē Field Architecture elevation
- **Quantum Integration**: Physics-Khalorēē Field Architecture merger
- **Archetypal Activation**: Universal pattern Khalorēē Field activation

### Cultural Systems
- **Sigil Programming**: Symbolic Khalorēē Field Architecture modification
- **Biological Events**: How Khalorēē Field Architecture changes manifest physically
- **Narrative Reality**: How stories shape actual reality

## Usage Guidelines
- **For Book Generation**: Provides the larger context for all character actions
- **For Plot Development**: Political and cosmic forces drive major plot points
- **For Consistency**: All events must align with Federation transformation plan

## Cross-References
- **Character System**: Characters navigate this political/cosmic landscape
- **Technology**: All tech serves the Federation transformation plan
- **Protocols**: Systems implement Federation Khalorēē Field Architecture evolution goals

## Narrative Integration
- **Macro Level**: Galactic Federation transformation drives trilogy arc
- **Meso Level**: House politics create regional conflicts and alliances
- **Micro Level**: Individual character growth serves larger cosmic evolution

This world building context ensures that individual character stories serve the larger narrative of universal Khalorēē Field Architecture evolution while maintaining political and social realism.
