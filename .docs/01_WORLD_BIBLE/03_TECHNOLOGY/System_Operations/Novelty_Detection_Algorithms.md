# Novelty Detection Algorithms
*WitnessOS Recognition of Genuinely New Patterns in Reality*

## Core Architecture

Novelty detection within WitnessOS operates on the principle that genuine novelty represents information that cannot be predicted from existing patterns. These algorithms continuously scan the Three Bodies of Chaos for signatures that indicate the emergence of truly new organizational structures.
