# Project: Somatic-Canticles Webapp

Companion experience to the Somatic-Canticles manuscript. The webapp uses biorhythm cycles to unlock chapters and content, guiding users through the WitnessOS framework via sound, breath, and somatic practice.

**Full vision and navigation:** `.docs/00-Project-Hub/README.md`, `.docs/index.md`

## Vision

- **Companion experience:** Readers don't just consume the book; they live inside its world.
- **Biorhythm-synced unlocks:** Chapters, insights, and practices align with the user's body rhythm (physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual).
- **Core loop:** Your Body's Rhythm → Unlocks Content → Deepens Practice → Builds Streak.

## Content Tiers
