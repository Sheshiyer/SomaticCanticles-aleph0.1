# Evolutionary Trajectories Documentation
*WitnessOS Mapping of Development Pathways Across All Emergence Patterns*

## Core Framework

Evolutionary trajectories represent the pathways through which emergence patterns develop over time. WitnessOS maps these trajectories not as predetermined paths, but as probability landscapes where Khalorēē Field Architecture, life, and matter explore their creative potential through the Three Bodies of Chaos.
