# Character System Map

*This document outlines the core, inherited belief systems (Khalorēē) of the main Somanaut team and maps their intersection with other key systems like the Enneagram and the Neuro-Endocrine Axis. This provides a multi-layered, consistent model for character behavior, motivation, and arcs.*

## **Dr. Corvan "Corv" Singh (The Psycho-Pathologist / Magus)**

*   **Core Khalorēē Axiom:** "Reality is a narrative."
    *   **Description:** Corv's system metabolizes the world as a collection of stories. Events are plot points, people are characters, and motivations are the drivers of the narrative. Nothing is random; it is all part of a text that can be read, interpreted, and, most importantly, edited. His reality is coherent when the story makes sense.

*   **Prana Expression:** *Interpretive Will.*
    *   **Description:** Corv's active Field Resonance is focused and penetrating. He projects his Khalorēē Field Architecture to find the "plot holes" in a system or the "thematic resonance" in an event. His Prana is the force of a powerful editor, seeking to impose a coherent narrative structure onto chaos.

*   **Enneagram Type:** 5 (The Investigator)
    *   **Motivation:** The desire to understand the world, to be competent and capable. Fears being useless, helpless, or incapable.

*   **Neuro-Endocrine Axis:** *Dominant Pineal/Hypothalamus Axis*
    *   **Description:** Highly attuned to cycles, patterns, and the "big picture." His system is primed for abstract thought and pattern recognition, but can be disconnected from the body's immediate, visceral reality.

*   **Integration:**
    *   Corv's **Type 5** need to understand manifests through his **Narrative Khalorēē**. He seeks competency by turning reality into a story he can analyze and master. His **Pineal/Hypothalamus Axis** provides the biological hardware for this, making him a natural pattern-seeker. His great fear is a story that makes no sense—an ontological paradox—as it renders him incapable and helpless, challenging the core of his Enneagram identity.

## **Dr. Sona Rey (The Intuitive Navigator / High Priestess)**

*   **Core Khalorēē Axiom:** "Reality is a resonance."
    *   **Description:** Sona's system metabolizes the world as a symphony of frequencies. Everything, from a cell to a memory to a thought, has a resonant signature. Coherence is harmony; incoherence is dissonance. She doesn't see or read reality; she *feels* its vibratory state.

*   **Prana Expression:** *Coherence Cultivation.*
    *   **Description:** Sona's active Field Resonance is empathic and enveloping. She projects her Khalorēē Field Architecture to feel the state of another system and broadcasts a coherent, harmonious frequency to soothe it, like a tuning fork bringing a string into pitch.

*   **Enneagram Type:** 9 (The Peacemaker)
    *   **Motivation:** The desire to create harmony in their environment, to avoid tension and conflict. Fears loss and separation.

*   **Neuro-Endocrine Axis:** *Dominant Thyroid/Heart Axis*
    *   **Description:** Her system is built around flow, connection, and empathetic regulation. The thyroid governs the body's metabolic rhythm, and the heart's electromagnetic field is her primary sensory organ.

*   **Integration:**
    *   Sona's **Type 9** desire for harmony is the engine of her **Resonant Khalorēē**. She seeks to avoid conflict by literally tuning the environment, using her **Thyroid/Heart Axis** to feel and smooth out dissonant frequencies. Her greatest fear—separation—is, for her, a state of ultimate dissonance, driving her to cultivate coherence wherever she goes.

## **Dr. Jian Li (The Neuro-Cartographer / Emperor)**

*   **Core Khalorēē Axiom:** "Reality is a system."
    *   **Description:** Jian's system metabolizes the world as a set of logical rules, systems, and interconnected data points. Everything can be mapped, measured, and understood if one has the right tools and enough data. Reality is a grand, complex machine. Coherence is a system functioning within its parameters; incoherence is a bug or a glitch.

*   **Prana Expression:** *Analytical Focus.*
    *   **Description:** Jian's active Field Resonance is precise and diagnostic. He projects his Khalorēē Field Architecture as a suite of powerful sensors, running scans and collecting data to build a perfect, high-fidelity map of the system he is investigating.

*   **Enneagram Type:** 1 (The Reformer)
    *   **Motivation:** The desire to be right, to strive higher and improve everything, to be consistent with their ideals. Fears being defective or corrupt.

*   **Neuro-Endocrine Axis:** *Dominant Prefrontal Cortex/Pituitary Axis*
    *   **Description:** His biology is primed for executive function, control, and regulation. The Pituitary is the "master gland," and his entire system is geared towards maintaining a precise, rule-based order.

*   **Integration:**
    *   Jian's **Type 1** need to be right and improve things is expressed through his **Systemic Khalorēē**. He sees a flawed reality and is driven to fix it, to debug it, to make it adhere to a more perfect, logical ideal. His **PFC/Pituitary Axis** gives him the biological focus and control to do so. His greatest fear is a system that is fundamentally irrational or "corrupt," as this violates his core drive for a perfect, orderly reality.

## **Gideon Vance (The Immunologist / Chariot)**

*   **Core Khalorēē Axiom:** "Reality is a structure to be defended."
    *   **Description:** Gideon's system metabolizes the world as a constant interplay between stable structures and the forces that seek to break them down. His world is one of boundaries, integrity, and defense. Coherence is a strong, stable system; incoherence is an invasion or a breach.

*   **Prana Expression:** *Systemic Integrity.*
    *   **Description:** Gideon's active Field Resonance is protective and stabilizing. He projects his Khalorēē Field Architecture as a shield, a kinetic barrier that reinforces the boundaries of the system he is in, repelling intrusive or chaotic Field Resonance.

*   **Enneagram Type:** 6 (The Loyalist)
    *   **Motivation:** The desire for security and support. To feel safe and have guidance. Fears being without support or guidance.

*   **Neuro-Endocrine Axis:** *Dominant Adrenal/Immune Axis*
    *   **Description:** His biology is a fortress. His adrenal system is always primed for a threat response (fight-or-flight), and his immune system is on high alert, constantly scanning for and neutralizing foreign invaders.

*   **Integration:**
    *   Gideon's **Type 6** need for security finds its voice in his **Structural Khalorēē**. He seeks safety by maintaining the integrity of boundaries, both his own and his team's (his "support system"). His **Adrenal/Immune Axis** is the hyper-vigilant biological engine for this, always ready to defend the structure. His greatest fear is a system breach or betrayal, as this threatens his core need for reliable support and a stable reality.
