- **Soma Vector:** Pure signal of Aletheia; resonant frequency of uncorrupted, unconcealed self
- **Vine of Determinism:** Inherited, deterministic reality created by one's Khalorēē
- **Coherence Cultivation:** Active practice of Aletheia; harmonizing the self
- **Severance Event:** Ultimate moment of Aletheia; complete unconcealment from Vine of Determinism
