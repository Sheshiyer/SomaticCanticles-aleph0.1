# Key Concepts & Definitions

*This document provides formal, in-universe definitions for core concepts and technologies used within the `Somatic Canticles` series.*

## Soma Vector

*   **Formal Definition:** A `Soma Vector` is a multi-dimensional pointer that directs the Somanauts to a specific, salient location within a subject's `Khalorēē`. It is not a simple set of 3D coordinates, but a complex data packet that includes biological, Quantum Systems, and narrative parameters.

*   **Analogy:** If a subject's Khalorēē Field Architecture is a city, a `Soma Vector` is not just a street address. It is the address, combined with the time of day, the emotional state of the neighborhood, the dominant topic of conversation on the street corner, and the barometric pressure. It provides the full context required for a meaningful "insertion" by the Anamnesis Engine.

*   **Function & Usage:**
    1.  **Initial Vector:** The first `Soma Vector` of any mission is established by the Probe, which scans for the point of greatest metabolic and Quantum Systems incoherence. This usually leads the team to the "epicenter" of the trauma (e.g., Chapter 1's "screaming" choroid plexus).
    2.  **Subsequent Vectors:** As the team gathers clues, they can establish new, more precise vectors. For example, the "sensory honeypot" in Chapter 3 didn't yield a memory, but a `Soma Vector` pointing to a specific genomic locus, guiding them from the Quantum Systems to the genetic realm.
    3.  **Resolution:** A vector is considered "resolved" when the team physically arrives at the location and confirms the nature of the target (e.g., arriving at the bio-resonant ganglion in Chapter 7).

## Triangulation Engine

*   **Formal Definition:** The `Triangulation Engine` is a specialized subroutine of the Anamnesis Engine's Glypt Core, designed specifically to analyze and map redacted, suppressed, or otherwise missing `Khalorēē` data.

*   **Analogy:** It operates on a principle similar to the discovery of dark matter. You cannot see the missing data directly, but you can precisely measure its "gravitational" effect on the surrounding, visible data. The Triangulation Engine maps these subtle distortions, ripples, and tidal effects in the narrative and Quantum Systems landscape.

*   **Function & Usage:**
    1.  **Void Analysis:** When a "data-void" is encountered (like the redacted module in Chapter 2), the Triangulation Engine is activated. It builds a multi-dimensional model of the void's boundaries.
    2.  **Hypothesis Generation:** Based on the shape and nature of the void, the Engine generates a series of high-probability hypotheses about what is being hidden. For example, it might determine that the void is shaped by "a suppressed authority figure" or "a deleted memory of physical trauma."
    3.  **Vector Targeting:** While it often cannot reveal the hidden data directly, the Engine's primary purpose is to generate a new `Soma Vector` that points to a *related, un-redacted* piece of data. It helps the team find the "loose thread" that, if pulled, will begin to unravel the entire redacted structure. It finds the keyhole so the team can craft the key.
