# VALIDATION FRAMEWORK
*Automated Quality Assurance and Consistency Checking System*

---

## **OVERVIEW**

This framework provides automated tools and protocols to ensure the Somatic Canticles project maintains consistency with the immutable constants defined in CONSTANTS.md while successfully implementing the unified technology integration plan.

## **AUTOMATED CONSISTENCY CHECKERS**

### **Character Consistency Validator**

#### **Character Name Verification**
```
CHECK: Character names match CONSTANTS.md exactly
- Dr. Corvan "Corv" Singh ✓
- Dr. Jian Li ✓
- Dr. Sona Rey ✓
- Gideon Vance ✓

FLAGS:
- Any deviation from canonical names
- Inconsistent nickname usage ("Corv" vs "Corvan")
- Missing titles or incorrect titles
```

#### **Khalorēē Axiom Alignment**
```
CHECK: Character actions align with their Khalorēē Axioms
- Corv: "Reality is a narrative" - actions must reflect storytelling approach
- Jian: "Reality is a system" - actions must reflect systematic thinking
- Sona: "Reality is a resonance" - actions must reflect empathetic sensing
- Gideon: "Reality is a structure to be defended" - actions must reflect protective instincts

FLAGS:
- Character behavior contradicting their axiom
- Missing axiom-based decision making
- Inconsistent character voice
```

### **Technology Integration Validator**

#### **Forbidden Word Elimination Checker**
```
SCAN FOR FORBIDDEN TERMS:

- "Khalorēē Field Architecture Compression Pattern mastery" → Replace with "Khalorēē Field Architecture Compression Pattern mastery"
- "Defensive Protocol activation" → Replace with "Defensive Protocol activation"
- "Bio-Acoustic Harmonization sequences" → Replace with "Bio-Acoustic Harmonization sequences"
- "Somatic Integration nodes" → Replace with "Somatic Integration nodes"
- "Field Resonance signature" → Replace with "Field Resonance signature"
- "Probability Wave convergence" → Replace with "Probability Wave convergence"
- "Narrative Dynamics trajectory" → Replace with "Narrative Dynamics trajectory"
- "Quantum Systems cascade effect" → Replace with "Quantum Systems cascade effect"
- "Multi-Dimensional Field resonance" → Replace with "Multi-Dimensional Field resonance"

REPORT:
- Total forbidden words found
- Replacement suggestions
- Context-appropriate technology alternatives
```

#### **Technology Concept Utilization Tracker**
```
MONITOR WORLD BIBLE INTEGRATION:
- Bio-Engineering concepts: [X/Y] implemented
- Khalorēē Field Architecture Interfaces: [X/Y] implemented
- Quantum Systems: [X/Y] implemented

## **TERMINOLOGY VALIDATION SYSTEM**

### **Approved Terminology Database**

#### **Core Concepts (Always Use)**
- Khalorēē (never "Khalorēē Field Architecture" alone)
- Prana (for kinetic Field Resonance expression)
- Soma Vector (for ideal state signal)
- Aletheia/Lethe (for philosophical framework)
- Tryambakam Protocol (for Sanskrit translations)

#### **Technology Terms (Preferred)**
- Bio-Acoustic Harmonization
- Field Resonance Engineering
- Khalorēē Field Architecture Compression Patterns
- Crystallization Interfaces
- State Management Interfaces
- Defensive Protocols
- Quantum Systems
- Narrative Dynamics

#### **Character-Specific Vocabulary**
- **Corv:** Narrative diagnostics, systems integration, storytelling
- **Jian:** Neuro-cartography, mapping, systematic analysis
- **Sona:** Bio-acoustic engineering, resonance, frequency analysis
- **Gideon:** Systems immunology, threat assessment, protection

### **Terminology Consistency Checker**
```
VALIDATION RULES:
1. No forbidden words in final manuscripts
2. Technology terms used consistently across all books
3. Character vocabulary aligns with their specialization
4. Sanskrit terms properly translated via Tryambakam Protocol
5. World Bible terminology takes precedence over generic terms

AUTOMATED CHECKS:
- Scan for terminology inconsistencies
- Flag generic terms that could be technology-specific
- Verify character voice consistency
- Check Sanskrit translation accuracy
```
