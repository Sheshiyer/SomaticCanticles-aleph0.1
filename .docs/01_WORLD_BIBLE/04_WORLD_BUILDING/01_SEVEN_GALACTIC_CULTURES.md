# SEVEN GALACTIC CULTURES

## **Overview**
The Somatic Canticles universe is organized around seven distinct galactic cultures, each representing different approaches to Khalorēē Field Architecture evolution and cultural advancement. Each culture has unique traditions, Khalorēē Field Architecture vessels, and advancement levels that shape their approach to the Aletheos Principle.
