# 🎵 Somatic-Canticles Webapp

> *The manuscript is the door. The webapp is the living world behind it.*

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

Somatic-Canticles is a **companion experience** to the manuscript—where readers don't just consume the book, but *live inside its world*. 

The webapp transforms the static manuscript into a **living, breathing system** that responds to each user's unique biorhythm cycles, unlocking:
- **BTS Content** — Behind-the-scenes of world-building, character origins, system frameworks
- **Biorhythm-Synced Unlocks** — Chapters, insights, and practices that align with your body's rhythm
- **Streaks & Continuity** — Track your journey through the WitnessOS framework
- **Deeper Vocabularies** — Gene Keys, Human Design, power numbers, celestial mapping
- **World-Building Access** — The full architecture of Somatic-Canticles universe beyond the page

**Core Concept:**
```
Your Body's Rhythm → Unlocks Content → Deepens Practice → Builds Streak
     ↓                      ↓                ↓                ↓
  Physical              BTS Insights      Embodiment       Mastery
  Emotional             World Lore        Resonance        Continuity
  Intellectual          System Frameworks Structure        Understanding
  Spiritual             Transcendence     Unity            Awakening
```

### Core Concept
```
Your Body's Rhythm → Unlocks Chapters → Guides Your Journey
     ↓                      ↓                ↓
  Physical              Movement         Embodiment
  Emotional             Sound/Frequency  Resonance
  Intellectual          Pattern/Code     Structure
  Spiritual             Transcendence    Unity
